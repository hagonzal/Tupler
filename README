Tupler is a parser for configuration files. A configuration file is composed
of tuples and tuples are composed of key value pairs. For example:

main_section {
 key1 = "some string";
 key2 = 12.23;
}

This defines a tuple named main_section with two keys: key1 and key2

The result of parsing a config file is a list of key value pairs. For the 
above example the pairs are:

main_section.key1 = "some string"
main_section.key2 = 12.23

Tuples can inherit from other tuples. For example:

derived_main : main_section {
  key1 = "override some string";
  key3 = 10;
}

The result of parsing both the main and derived sections is:

main_section.key1 = "some string"
main_section.key2 = 12.23

derived_main.key1 = "override some string"
derived_main.key2 = 12.23
derived_main.key3 = 10

A snippet of code of how to use the library:

#include "config/config_map.h"
#include "config/tuple_parser.h"

int main() {
  ...
  ConfigMap *map = parse_config_file(file_name);
  std::string key1 = map->GetString("main_section.key1");
  double key2 = map->GetDouble("main_section.key2");
  ...
}
